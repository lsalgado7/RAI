*   **AMD:** Offers a more diversified business model, competitive pricing for its GPU offerings, and holds strong potential in the expanding inference market.

## Conclusion:

Nvidia currently leads in revenue, profitability, and market share within the critical AI and data center sectors. However, AMD presents a compelling growth narrative driven by its diversified business and increasing competitiveness, particularly where price is a significant factor. The choice between these two technology powerhouses hinges on an investor's risk appetite and investment horizon.
